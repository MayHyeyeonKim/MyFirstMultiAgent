# ETF 모멘텀 전략 입문 가이드


## ETF란?


Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a type of investment fund that tracks the performance of a particular index, commodity, or sector. Unlike mutual funds, which are traded on an exchange once a day, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like individual stocks. This allows investors to gain exposure to various asset classes, sectors, or geographic regions with greater flexibility.

ETFs come in different forms, such as:

* Equity ETFs: track stock market indexes
* Fixed Income ETFs: invest in bonds and other debt securities
* Alternative ETFs: focus on alternative investments like commodities, currencies, or cryptocurrencies


## 모멘텀 전략이란?


Momentum investing is a strategy that focuses on identifying and riding the waves of market trends. It involves using various metrics to identify assets with strong price momentum, which are likely to continue their upward trend.

Key concepts in momentum investing include:

* Mean reversion: the idea that asset prices will eventually return to their historical means
* Trend: the direction in which an asset's price is moving
* Sentiment: investors' overall attitude towards a particular asset or market


## ETF 모멘텀 전략의 장점과 단점


Advantages of ETF momentum strategies include:


* Flexibility: can be used for various types of assets, sectors, and geographic regions
* Diversification: allows investors to gain exposure to multiple assets with a single investment
* Liquidity: ETFs can be traded throughout the day, providing easy access to capital

However, there are also some disadvantages to consider:


* Volatility: momentum strategies can lead to significant losses if market conditions change quickly
* Market risk: ETF prices can fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably
* Overfitting: relying too heavily on past data may not accurately predict future performance


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for ETF 모멘텀 전략


To evaluate the effectiveness of an ETF momentum strategy, consider the following KPIs:


* Moving averages (MA): simple, exponential, and weighted to identify trends
* Return on investment (ROI) and total return to measure performance
* Volatility: standard deviation and value at risk (VaR) to assess risk


## Risk Management for ETF 모멘텀 전략


To manage the risks associated with ETF momentum strategies:


* Understand volatility: standard deviation and value at risk (VaR) to quantify potential losses
* Optimize position sizing: use maximum drawdown to determine optimal portfolio size
* Monitor sentiment: keep an eye on investor sentiment to avoid overbought or oversold conditions


## Backtesting and Evaluation of ETF 모멘텀 전략


Backtesting is the process of evaluating a strategy's past performance using historical data. This can help identify potential biases and areas for improvement.

A simple example of walk-forward optimization in Python:

```
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import norm

# Load historical stock prices
df = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')

# Calculate mean reversion metrics
mr_metrics = ...

# Evaluate strategy performance using backtesting
backtested_results = ...
```


## Conclusion and Next Steps
